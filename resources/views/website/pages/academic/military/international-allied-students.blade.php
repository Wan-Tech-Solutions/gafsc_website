                                    <p class="mb-20">
                                        The Junior Division of the Ghana Armed Forces Command and Staff College,(GAFCSC),
                                        initially known as the National War College (NWC), was established on 14 October
                                        1963 as part of the Military Academy and Training Schools (MATS). The College was
                                        staffed by officers of the Canadian Armed Forces Training Team (CAFTT) and a British
                                        Army Officer. They were charged with the responsibility of training selected Army
                                        Officers for staff and higher command appointments.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-20">
                                        In December 1963, the NWC was renamed the National Defence College (NDC), and the
                                        course duration increased from 10 to 21 weeks. In January 1964, the institution was
                                        once again renamed the Junior Defence College (JDC). The first Ghanaian Directing
                                        Staff in the person of then Major JM Nunoo-Mensah was appointed to the College in
                                        1969. He became the first Ghanaian to head the institution as General Staff Officer
                                        Grade I in 1970. The JDC was opened to students from allied African countries in
                                        1973.

                                    <p class="mb-20">With the establishment of the Ghana Armed Forces Command and Staff
                                        College (GAFCSC) in 1976, the Junior Defence College became the Junior Division of
                                        the GAFCSC. The head of the Division was also upgraded to Assistant Commandant
                                        (Colonel) effective October 1985 with Colonel Seidu Ayumah as the first Assistant
                                        Commandant. In February 2007, there was a further upgrade of the appointment to the
                                        rank of a Brigadier General. </p>

                                        The scope of the Division has also been reviewed over the years with more emphasis
                                        on Staff Training for Grade 3 Staff appointments whilst the command and tactics
                                        aspects have been de-emphasized. The course duration is now 24 weeks.
